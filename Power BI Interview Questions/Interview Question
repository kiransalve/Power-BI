1. What is append and merge query?

Merge in power bi is like vlookup in excel
we merge two table based on one common column
it will merge two table horizontaly

Append in power bi means we stack two table below other
we combin both vertically 
the column of both table should be same 

2. Reference vs. Duplicate in Power Query

Duplicate - it is independent table of original table, no effect if original table changes
all steps are copied from original table

Reference - it is depends on original table, every changes in orginal table also reflects in reference table
it has only source steps in applied steps, it pointed to source

3. What is query folding?

Query Folding is the process where Power BI pushes the transformation back to data source.

You can check if a step supports Query Folding by right-clicking the step in Power Query and 
clicking "View Native Query". If it's clickable, folding is working!

It support only SQL databases, MS SQL server, SAP Hana and Azure SQL database

Excel, CSV, NOSQL database and web data not supports query folding

We can filter, remove/rename/add columns, remove duplicates in query folding

It will make power bi fast because transformation done by source system, so less data processed by power bi
making reports load and refresh faster

It uses less memory as power bi needs to handle less raw data

Query folding is required to incremental refresh to work properly
